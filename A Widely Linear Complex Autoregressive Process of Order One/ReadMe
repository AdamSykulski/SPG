Description of code

WidelyLinearComplexFigs.zip
  - Code to generate Figures 1,3,4,5,6 for the analysis of the seismic data
  - Code to generate Figure 2 which compares the widely linear process with the improper process of Picinbono and Bondon (1997)
  - complexAR1inv.m is the inverse matrix M^{-1} of equation (15), discussed on page 5 in the paper
